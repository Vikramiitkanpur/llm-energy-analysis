# LLM-Based Energy Data Analysis

## Name: Vikram Kumar

## LLM Used: mistral-saba-24b via Groq 

## Dataset:
UCI Household Power Consumption Dataset
Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

## Tasks Completed:
1. Average active power in March 2007
2. Peak hour usage on Christmas 2006
3. Weekday vs weekend usage
4. Days with usage > 5kWh
5. Trend plot for Jan 1–7, 2007
6. Average daily voltage in Feb 1–7, 2007
7. Correlation with sub-metering

## How to Run:
1.Download the dataset from the UCI website:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

2. Extract the ZIP file, and make sure the file household_power_consumption.txt is in the same folder as the llm_queries.ipynb.

3. Open the llm_queries.ipynb file 

4. Run each cell in order to preprocess the data, run LLM-generated code, and view the outputs.

## Requirements:
- pandas
- matplotlib
